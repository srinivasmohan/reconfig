This config uses 'altkeys' too. Using altkeys param, you can pull in values from other etcd keys into your config as well.
(The keys in altkeys are not watched for changed but rather fetched as-is whenever the main key changes)

The main key we watched for was "<%= @reconfig["watched"] %>".

Data based on main key (This key was being watched for changes):
<% @reconfig["data"].keys.each do |x| %>
KEY=<%= x %> VAL=<%= @reconfig["data"][x] %>
<% end %>

Data based on altkeys section (These are not watched but instead fetched from etcd whenever main key changes)
<% @reconfig["altdata"].keys.each do |thiskey| %>
Altkey=<%= thiskey %> - This points to a hash:
<%= JSON.pretty_generate(@reconfig["altdata"][thiskey]) %>
---

<% end %>
